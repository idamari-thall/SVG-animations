<!-- Create the SVG images provided. Create a minimum of two. 
At least one SVG should be created in the HTML document and 
at least one should be created in an SVG document and linked 
to the HTML document. After creating at least two SVGs, 
feel free to create more and even make your own! 
TIP: creating SVGs is a lot easier if you take some time 
to plan out the design before you start coding. 
Take some grid paper and plan out the size of your graphic, 
where the points should be placed, and get an understanding of 
how each element of the graphic fits together.  -->
